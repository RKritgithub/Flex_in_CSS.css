<!-- Question-1: -->
<!-- Describe the main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model. and the CSS Grid layout model. When
would you choose the use one over the other? -->
<!-- Answer: -->
<!-- The main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model is in how they handle the arrangement and positioning of elements within a container. -->


<!-- CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box) Layout Model:

Flexbox is primarily designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
It's best suited for arranging items along a single axis, allowing for flexible and responsive design of complex layouts in that one dimension.
Elements within a flex container can expand and contract to fill available space, and they can also be aligned within that single axis.
It is commonly used for things like navigation menus, toolbars, and aligning content within a container, where the arrangement is more linear. -->


<!-- CSS Grid Layout Model:

Grid layout, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional layouts, meaning you can define both rows and columns in a grid.
It excels in creating complex, grid-based structures and is well-suited for creating overall page layouts.
Grid allows for precise control over the placement of items in both the row and column dimensions, and it's often used for creating responsive web designs where content can be placed in various positions on the page. -->


<!-- Use Flexbox when: -->

<!-- 1.You need to arrange items along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).
2.You want elements to distribute space within a container based on their content.
3.You're working with smaller, more linear components or design elements within a larger container. -->



<!-- Use Grid when: -->

<!-- 1.You need to create a two-dimensional grid of items, aligning content in both rows and columns.
2.You want to establish a complex overall page layout with distinct sections.
3.You need to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes or orientations.
You require precise control over the placement of items. -->
